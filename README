CS118 Project 2

Project Summary

I) Team Members:  
Sangyeop Lee: 003-950-078
Julian Brown: 303-946-971
Dennis Shen: 004-002-509

II) Individual Contribution:
Sangyeop Lee: implemented icmp echo request / reply. came up with the idea of dividing up sr_handlepacket
into the case when 1) ping/traceroutes are forwarded to router's interfaces and 2) forwarded to web servers.
Also implemented the function to find the address with the longest prefix matching. (pathSeeker())

Julian Brown: implemented icmp_handler() to handle type 3 and type 11 icmp messages and was also responsible for 
handling arp request (forwardNewRequest() and arpHandler()) and using them in sr_arpcache_sweepreqs()

Dennis Shen: handled arp request and sending arp replies in sr_handlepacket. also wrote the checksumming ip header
in sr_handlepacket. debugged the code a lot. also responsible for checking whether header size is sane, and whether
protocol types are valid etc.

III) What our code does
our code supports the following functionalities 
1) pinging from the client to any of the router's interfaces (192.168.2.1, 172.64.3.1, 10.0.1.1) 
2) Tracerouting from the client to any of the routher's interfaces
3) Pinging from the client to any of the app servers (192.168.2.2, 172.64.3.10)
4) Tracerouting from the client to any of the app servers 
5) Downloading a file using HTTP from one of the app servers

Note: Due to time constraint and other commitments to other classes, 
we were unable to test our router's capabilities beyond the above 5 functionalities, although we believe
our sweepreq implementation is very accurate, conforming to the pseudocode in the sr_arpcache.h file
